## Overview

Smart Farm is an innovative agricultural project implemented using Arduino technology. It aims to enhance farming efficiency through automation and remote control, making it easier for farmers to manage their resources effectively.

## Features

### 1. Remote Control

Farmers can control irrigation and water tanks from anywhere:

- **Sprinkler Control**: 
  - Farmers can turn the sprinklers on and off directly from the app, saving time and effort.

- **Water Tank Management**: 
  - Monitor water levels in tanks and manage them without needing to visit the farm.

### 2. Automated Operation

The smart farm utilizes modern technologies for efficient management:

- **Soil Moisture Sensors**: 
  - These sensors measure soil moisture levels. When moisture drops, the system automatically activates the sprinklers to irrigate the plants.

- **Water Tank Sensors**: 
  - If the water level in the tank is low, the system automatically activates the pump from the well to refill the tank.

## Conclusion

Smart Farm represents a significant advancement in agricultural technology, allowing farmers to optimize their operations and ensure better crop management with minimal manual intervention.
